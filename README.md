# Library

## Project Proposal

This project is an application for a librarys system.

It allows library users to
- Borrow books
- Donate their old books
- See information about books including author, genre and review rating
- Return books they have taken out
- Leave reviews for books they return

It will also allow users to **search** through the library catalogue through categories like author and genre and read other user reviews that have been left, and will provide an average rating for the books, based on reviews. 
The application will also have functionality to track users reading history. 

This application would be used by library users at a library who are interested in taking out or donating books, or curious about others ratings of books.

## Personal interest in this project
I personally like reading books and am excited to work on this abstraction of them through this project.
The project also provides a fun challenge, with the functionality for users to leave and read reviews and search through books through a number of different search criteria.
