# Library

## Project Proposal

This project is an application for a library system.

It allows library **members** to
- Borrow books
- Donate their old books
- See information about books including author, genre and review rating
- Return books they have taken out
- Leave reviews for books they return
- If the user is indecisive, the application can choose a random book for the user to read, to expand their literature tastes

It will also allow users to **search** through the library catalogue through categories like author and genre and read other user reviews that have been left, and will provide an average rating for the books, based on reviews. 
The application also have functionality to track users reading history and provide information on their reading habits like favourite/most-read book/author/genre. 

This application would be used by library members at a library who are interested in taking out books, or curious about others ratings of books.

## Personal interest in this project
I personally like reading books and am excited to work on this abstraction of them through this project.
The project also provides a nice challenge, with the functionality for users to leave and read reviews and search through books through a number of different search criteria.
